Pente is a simple game where two players take turns placing peices on a board. In order to win, a player must place 5 pieces in a row or capture the opponent five times. A capture occures when a player places a piece so that their pieces surround a group of two of their opponent's pieces on either side. If a player captures their opponent, the two pieces are removed from the board.
